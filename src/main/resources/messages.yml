# --- JSON COMPONENTS --- #
# There are 6 different types of JSON components that can be used to send messages (each one can have hover text):
# - "text"      A string of text that when hovered over, shows text.
# - "prompt"    A string of text that when clicked, will put text into the player's chat box.
# - "clipboard" A string of text that when clicked, will copy the text to the player's clipboard.
# - "chat"      A string of text that when clicked, will force the player to send a chat message.
# - "command"   A string of text that when clicked, will force the player to run a command.
# - "web"       A string of text that when clicked, will open a web page.
#
# The characters you put in plugin.splitter are used to split the message into the component arguments.
# By default, the splitter is "@@", which is what will be used in the examples below.
#
# This is the format of a single message, all single messages are "prompt" components:
key1: "display1@@hover1@@prompt1"
# Sent to player: "display1"
# Shown on hover: "hover1"
# Put in player's chat bar when clicked: "prompt1"
#
# "display1" cannot be empty. If it is, the key name will be sent.
# "hover1" can be empty. If it is, a normal (non-JSON) message will be sent.
# "prompt1" can be empty. If it is, a "text" message will be sent.
#
# These are the formats of an advanced message, all advanced message components depend on what they're sub-key start with:
key2:
  text: "display2@@hover2"
  # Sent to player: "display3"
  # Shown on hover: "hover3"
  prompt: "display3@@hover3@@prompt2"
  # Sent to player: "display4"
  # Shown on hover: "hover4"
  # Put in player's chat bar when clicked: "prompt2"
  clipboard: "display4@@hover4@@clipboard1"
  # Sent to player: "display5"
  # Shown on hover: "hover5"
  # Copied to player's clipboard when clicked: "clipboard1"
  chat: "display5@@hover5@@chat1"
  # Sent to player: "display6"
  # Shown on hover: "hover6"
  # Chat message sent by player when clicked: "chat1"
  command: "display6@@hover6@@command1"
  # Sent to player: "display7"
  # Shown on hover: "hover7"
  # Command sent by player when clicked: "command1"
  web: "display7@@hover7@@web1"
  # Sent to player: "display8"
  # Shown on hover: "hover8"
  # Website prompted to open when clicked: "web1"
#
# "display" cannot be empty. If it is, the message will not be sent.
# "hover" can be empty. If it is, a normal (non-JSON) message will be sent.
# "prompt", "clipboard", "chat", "command", and "web" can be empty. If they are, a "text" message will be sent.
#
# All the messages in the above example will be strung together into a single message, "display1display2display3display4display5display6display7"
# This way you can create something like this: "[Accept][Decline]". When clicking on one of the options, it can run different functions/commands.
#
# To have multiple of the same components in a message, you simply have to put any text after the component's name:
key3:
  command-accept: "[Accept]@@Accept the request@@accept"
  command-decline: "[Decline]@@Decline the request@@deny"
# The name of a "text" sub-key doesn't matter since it's the default component (just don't have it start with another component's name).
# --- END JSON COMPONENTS --- #


# This message can be used to test practically anything!
test: "%prefix%This is a test message!"

# Messages for general plugin usage
plugin:
  # This will be what %prefix% is in all the other messages
  # %prefix% can be used in any message in this file as many times as you want
  prefix: "&3&lANNOYING &8&l| &b"

  # These are the different splitters for messages/placeholders
  splitters:
    # This is the splitter for the JSON components (see above). Default: "@@"
    json: "@@"
    # This is the splitter for the placeholders. Default: "=="
    placeholder: "=="
